(the "Replication Client" is a specific privilege that allows a user to access 
information related to the database replication process. Replication in MySQL 
is the process of copying data from one MySQL server (the master) to one or 
more MySQL servers (the replicas or slaves), maintaining a consistent data 
set across multiple database instances.)
